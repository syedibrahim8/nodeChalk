// What is dotenv in Node.js
/*
dotenv is a node.js package that loads environment variable from a .env file into process.env

This is useful because:
You dont want secure (API keys, DB passwords) inside your code.
You want different configs for dev,staging,production.
You want clean, maintainable configuration

Installation:
npm install dotenv
